# MJRdev.info Website Source
_____

This is my personal website source.
Here I have created a Flask Python, HTML, and CSS web app that serves as a portfolio and place for all of my ideas and work to go. 

Deployment: https://mjrtech.herokuapp.com/

# What is 'MJRdev.info'?

This is a Python Flask Web Server that acts as my personal portfolio and a base for any of my on going projects.
All back-end applications and server renders are done using python and namely the flask library.
To not rely on javascript to much, the front-end of the site site is styled and almost completely coded with HTML5 and CSS except for automation scripts.
Styling and formatting webpages is not my strong suit an thus i wanted to keep the styling as simple and elegent as possible.
Managing the deployment and backend of the site are all pyhton utilies and are as light weight as possble, back-end dependencies as well as a postgreSQL database for managing any data that runs through the sites.

# How to run this app

First, you will need to install Python 3 on your machine. Using your platforms prefered method.
Second you will need to install Flask using pip3 via the `pip3 install flask` command.
After this run from the `app.py` file and visit your local host to view the website locally.
